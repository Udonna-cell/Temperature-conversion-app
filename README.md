### New things learned or refreshed:

I learn how to convert string decimal number to numbers Example

```js
 var num1 = parseFloat("21.427"); // returns 21.427
```

**Lines of code:**

* 17 lines of code.

**Time to code:**

This took about **1 hour** to code.

**Biggest take away:**

*converting string number to numbers*.
I tried to use the parseInt(); to achieve that and it works but the answers will not be accurate, because if the string number is a decimal number it will return an integer.
*Example*
```js
var num1 = parseInt("21.427"); // returns 21
var num1 = parseFloat("21.427"); // returns 21.427
```
So the best option to take is the parseFloat() to get a better and accurate result.
